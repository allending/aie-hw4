## <h1 align="center" id="heading">🔍Your First Retrieval Augmented Generation QA Application!</h1>

### Outline:

🤜 BREAKOUT ROOM #1:
- Task 1: Imports and Utilities
- Task 2: Documents
- Task 3: Embeddings and Vectors
- Task 4: Prompts
- Task 5: Retrieval Augmented Generation
     - 🚧 ACTIVITY #1: Augment RAG

### Steps to Run:

1. Create a Python 3.11 environment
2. `pip install jupyter` so you can run the notebook
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements

# Build 🏗️

Run the notebook!

# Ship 🚢

- Add one of the following "extras" to the RAG pipeline:
     - Allow it to work with PDF files
     - Implement a new distance metric
     - Add metadata support to the vector database
- Make a simple diagram of the RAG process
- Run the notebook
- Record a Loom walking through the notebook, the questions in the notebook, and your addition!

# Share 🚀
- Show your App in a loom video and explain the diagram
- Make a social media post about your final application and tag @AIMakerspace
- Share 3 lessons learned
- Share 3 lessons not learned

Here's a template to get your post started!

🚀 Exciting News! 🎉

I just built and shipped my very first Retrieval Augmented Generation QA Application using Chainlit and the OpenAI API! 🤖💼 

🔍 Three Key Takeaways:
1️⃣ The power of combining traditional search methods with state-of-the-art generative models is mind-blowing. 🧠✨
2️⃣ Collaboration and leveraging community resources like AI Makerspace can greatly accelerate the learning curve. 🌱📈
3️⃣ Dive deep, keep iterating, and never stop learning. Each project brings a new set of challenges and equally rewarding lessons. 🔄📚

A huge shoutout to the @AI Makerspace for their invaluable resources and guidance. 🙌

Looking forward to more AI-driven adventures! 🌟 Feel free to connect if you'd like to chat more about it! 🤝
